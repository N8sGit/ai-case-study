# Pinecone

## Overview and Origin

Pinecone is a vector database provider founded in 2019 by the former Research Director at AWS Edo Liberty, and is headquartered in San Francisco with additional offices in New York City and Tel Aviv. Pinecone aims to be a leading provider of vector databases, an important component of the increasingly standard Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for generative AI applications. As one of the first, and highest profile movers in this space, Pinecone is already showing many promising growth signs and indications that it is on track to become a household name in the AI industry.

## What problem does Pinecone address?

With the sudden explosion of generative AI applications hitting the market, a new approach to data management is needed that complements how these models work. More conventional databases, which use scalar values to index data, struggle to interoperate with large language model (LLM) applications that involve more open-ended, complex and often vague natural language requests. To work with scalar databases, a language model would have to correctly classify a verbal request and translate it into a valid expression in a query language, such as SQL. Then that expression would need to be extracted and sent to the database through an explicitly defined API. What the database returns would then need to be reinserted into the prompt at post-processing before the final result is interpreted by the LLM and presented to the user. (Author's note: I know this because this is what we had to do at my last job before we used Pinecone.)

This whole process is brittle, error prone, and unpredictable. Given the stochastic, indeterministic behavior of LLMs, there’s no guarantee that it will reliably translate a verbal request into the correct query expression and succeed at every one of these steps with guranteed reliability. In other words, entrusting an LLM's code generation capababilities to handle what should be deterministic database retrieval operations is risky. When dealing with potentially sensitive factual data, it is imperative that LLMs working with that data do not play “fast and loose” when interpreting and presenting it.

Instead, vector databases more naturally align with the workings of neural network models, providing what is effectively a factual “long term memory” store for them.  

## Who is Pinecone for?

Pinecone is for developers working on AI applications and companies looking to provide AI with factual knowledge bases and data specific to their platforms or services. 

Having now explained what Pinecone does and why it’s doing it, we will now define and explain two key technical concepts at the heart of Pinecone’s product: vector databases and retrieval augmented generation.

## What is a vector database? 

A vector database is a type of database that processes data differently than more conventional scalar, tabular, structured or relational databases. Unlike more traditional databases, vector DBs index data using a mathematical structure called a vector embedding rather than a scalar primary key or strict “unique identifier”. Everything a vector DB contains is mapped to what is called a vector or semantic, space. Items are retrieved based on how closely tokenized request’s vector comes to the corresponding stored item’s. What this means is that vector DBs are better suited to unstructured data retrieval based on similarity or “semantic search”. This makes vector DBs a natural fit for NLP applications such as chatbots that need to access and retrieve privately held data in addition to answering queries on the basis of its general knowledge acquired during model training. 

Because user requests for such chatbot applications are often delivered in less precise natural language rather than say, an SQL statement, the AI benefits from the flexibility of vector embeddings to translate that verbal query into a closely matching result by applying the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm over the vector space.

Vector DBs are designed to work with unstructured data, meaning data that isn’t readily formatted to the cells of a grid or table. Because all data, regardless of format, is stored as vectors, vector DBs have the advantage of considerable flexibility over more traditional scalar databases. Vector DB’s “type agnosticism” means it can retrieve video clips, pdfs, plain text, images, or any other type of content without requiring special rules or buckets for each data type. All data is mapped to the same “continuous” high dimensional vector space, regardless of its content. Additionally, the data it stores does not need to be labeled, indexed according to a primary key, or carry any of the retrieval oriented metadata, such as keywords, associated with structured data. Only what matters is the “coordinates” the vector encoding for that data object describes of its “location” in the semantic vector space. Rather than applying selectors to access items stored in data tables, vector DBs use a similarity comparison to match a request to a database item that best overlaps or approximates its vector coordinates. 

## What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?
RAG is a software architecture design pattern for AI applications that is rapidly growing in popularity and is arguably becoming an industry standard approach. The term derives from a 2020 paper by researchers at Facebook AI Research, University College London, and New York University. [^1]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf]). RAG addresses the problem of pairing AI programs, often NLP chatbots, with organized, domain specific data in addition to the model’s more generic, domain general “parameterized” learnings. For example, if one were to ask vanilla ChatGPT for one’s bosses’ email address, ChatGPT would not know the answer. An internal HR AI assistant at the company, however, might be built with RAG, and so can retrieve such domain-specific data from the company database that has been integrated with the chatbot functionality. 

The RAG architecture also permits NLP apps to associate its statements with sources to provide citations and similar factual supporting material, improving the traceability, credibility, and explainability of these model’s behavior. 

The goal of RAG is to make such AI apps more factual and informed by giving it access to domain-specific data and encouraging it to rely on this information as its main “source of truth”. The RAG pattern has had much success in mitigating the problem of AI hallucinations—the tendency for models to make false claims to fill in gaps in its knowledge. RAG architecture directs models to favor the provided source of truth over and above the models own speculations

## What does Pinecone offer?

Pinecone’s flagship product is its (optionally) serverless  vector database. According to its website, [^3]([https://www.pinecone.io/]) Pinecone advertises itself as providing the means to build “knowledgable AI”. It claims to deliver results that are fast, accurate, and cheap, with 51ms query latency,  96% recall accuracy, at up to 50x lower cost. [^4](https://www.pinecone.io/product/). Pinecone’s vector DB solution comes equipped with SDKs for popular programming languages, a unified implementation-agnostic API, and works with any commercially available AI model. It has integrations with many popular AI service providers. Pinecone’s product is richly featured, and supports hybrid search (pairing it with more conventional keyword lookups), real time updates, and metadata filtering. 

## How well is Pinecone doing?

Pinecone bills itself as the most popular vector database provider on the market (ibid). According to Crunchbase [^5]([https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pinecone]), Pinecone has a total of $138M in funding after 4 funding rounds. Pinecone’s customers and partners include established factors such as Microsoft, Notion, Accenture, GoDaddy, and Zapier. [^6]([https://www.pinecone.io/customers/]) For such a young company at only 5 years old, these signs are encouraging. Pinecone is also one of the first companies to provide such a sophisticated "plug and play" solution, which means it is well positioned from the start for continued success and can even set the bar by which other solutions are judged. 

## Pinecone’s competitors 

Pinecone is by no means alone in providing a vector DB solution. Its competitors include the open source Qdrant and ElasticSearch, and solutions offered by major companies such as Amazon’s CloudSearch and Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Search. It’s worth noting, however, that Pinecone’s for-profit status, ample funding, and specialization in the vector DB field means it can attract world-class talent dedicated to the subject and focus all its resources and attention on improving its vector DB solutions. This gives it an advantage over free and open source projects, which rely on less dependable volunteer contributions, and major tech companies, who offer a diverse array of products and services and may therefore not prioritize their vector db capabilities above everything else they offer. Pinecone has both the resources and motivation to provide the best vector DB solution on the market. 

## Pinecone’s future prospects

Considering Pinecone’s already proven track record and industry forecasts that predict considerable growth in the AI field over the coming years [^7](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ai-statistics/), it’s a safe bet that if these trends continue, Pinecone is positioned to enjoy more success in the future. The company’s basic proposition, that vector DBs are an essential component to “knowledgable AI”, seems to be increasingly accepted among the engineering community, and is already widely implemented across a variety of popular platforms and services now in production. 

It should be noted that the AI field is fast moving and unpredictable. New advances are appearing at an unprecedented pace. So there’s no telling if some other as of yet unforeseen approach might appear on the scene and displace RAG and vector databases as the emerging best practice. Considering how much companies have already invested in proven vector DB powered RAG systems, however, it’s both plausible and probable that these technologies and methods have cemented their status as go-to solutions for the foreseeable future.
